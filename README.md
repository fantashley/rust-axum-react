# Rust Axum x React Example Project

This project demonstrates how a React app can be embedded into a Rust binary
using Axum as the backend framework.

The React app is located in the `vite-project` folder, and the Rust binary
embeds the `dist` folder that gets generated by building the React project.

## Build and Run

Make sure you have Node.js installed: [Download
Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

1. Build the React project to create the dist folder that will be embedded.

    ```bash
    cd vite-project
    npm install
    npm run build
    ```

2. Run the crate to serve the app

    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```

3. The app should be accessible at <http://localhost:3000>

## Development

It's quicker to develop the React app using its development server so you get
the benefits of live reload. In order to do that, you can run the below
commands.

```bash
cd vite-project
npm run dev
```
